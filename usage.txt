Usage: node [--harmony] scion-shell [options] path/to/file.scxml 

Options:

"event-format"    : One of ["json","string","auto"]. 
                    If "json", expects input to be formatted as JSON.
                    If "string", expects input to simply be a string, which is the event name. 
                        It is not possible to pass in event data using this option.
                    If "auto", the interpreter will attempt to parse the input as JSON. If that fails, input will be used as an event name.
                        This is the default option.

"event-delimiter" : This is the character which serves as a delimiter between events. By default it is the newline character.

"log-state-entry" : If set to true, the interpreter will log the ids of states entered to stdout. This can be useful in debugging.

"log-state-exit"  : If set to true, the interpreter will log the ids of states exited to stdout.

"graphical-trace" : If set to true, will graphically render the SCXML file, and animate the rendering in response to state enter and exit actions.
                        If this option is true, then node must be executed with the "--harmony" flag.
